  - Project Documantation: [Documentation_Project2_1115201800061.pdf](https://github.com/giannhskp/Operating-Systems/blob/main/Project2/Documentation_Project2_1115201800061.pdf)

Developed an app that finds all the prime numbers inside a given range. The app implements a flexible tree with processes in order to find those numbers:
  - At first the process hierarchy is created using fork system calls.
  - Nodes at different hierarchy levels execute different and independent executables that communicate using Pipes and Signals.

Main Objectives:
  - Unix System Calls
  - Process Creation using system calls.
  - Management and Synchronization of the new processes.
  - Communication between processes using Pipes and Signals.
