Developed an app that independent programms run concurrently and simulate a "Salad Creation" inside a restaurant kitchen.

Main Objectives:
  - Using POSIX Semaphores in order to synchronize and achieve a successful cooperation between the independent processes and use of Shared Memory segment.
  - Every proccess attaches the same shared memory segment in order to access variables/data structures that they need and also "communicate" with the other processes.
